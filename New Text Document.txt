DataOps Project Presentation
Slide 1: Introduction
Project Title: ERP Data Integration and Transformation Using DataOps Practices
Objective: Seamless ingestion, transformation, and visualization of ERP data (Payment Receipt doctype) using modern DataOps tools and methodologies.
Key Tools & Technologies:
Docker
Apache Airflow
DuckDB
dbt Core
Great Expectations
Streamlit
Slide 2: Summary
Scope:
Ingest ERP data via APIs.
Store raw data in DuckDB.
Transform data with dbt Core, applying star schema modeling and validation.
Visualize the transformed data using Streamlit.
Goals:
Improve data quality and pipeline efficiency.
Enable actionable insights through reliable data visualization.
Slide 3: Approach + DataOps
Approach:
Ingestion: API-based data fetching.
Storage: DuckDB for lightweight, high-performance storage.
Transformation: dbt Core for modular, version-controlled transformations.
Validation: Great Expectations for automated quality checks.
Visualization: Streamlit for interactive dashboards.
DataOps Practices:
Agile, iterative development.
Automation and CI/CD pipelines for reproducibility.
Continuous monitoring and validation for trustworthiness.
Slide 4: Design + Dataflow
Design Highlights:
Modular pipeline with clearly defined stages.
Scalable and containerized infrastructure using Docker.
Focus on reusability and maintainability with dbt and Airflow.

Slide 5: Built of Material
Tools:
Docker: Ensures portability and consistency.
Apache Airflow: Manages workflow orchestration.
DuckDB: Provides a fast, local analytical database.
dbt Core: Modular SQL transformations with lineage tracking.
Great Expectations: Validates data quality.
Streamlit: Offers an easy-to-use framework for dashboards.
Resources:
ERP API documentation.
Cloud/Local infrastructure for deployment.
Team collaboration and version control tools (e.g., Git).
Slide 6: Planning
Timeline:
Week 1: Requirements gathering and design.
Week 2-3: Data ingestion setup with Airflow and Docker.
Week 4-5: Transformation logic in dbt Core.
Week 6: Data validation and testing with Great Expectations.
Week 7: Dashboard development in Streamlit.
Week 8: Final testing, documentation, and deployment.
Milestones:
Working ingestion pipeline.
Validated star schema in DuckDB.
Fully functional Streamlit dashboard.
Slide 7: Next Steps
Integrate CI/CD pipelines for dbt models and data validation checks.
Explore scaling options for larger data volumes.
Enhance dashboard interactivity and user experience.
Conduct user training and gather feedback.
Slide 8: Open Questions
Are there specific ERP fields that need additional attention during validation?
Should we plan for real-time data ingestion or stick to batch updates?
What additional visualizations or KPIs would be most beneficial in the dashboard?
Are there other compliance or security considerations for handling the data?
